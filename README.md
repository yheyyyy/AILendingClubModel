# Lending Club Loan Prediction Project

This project is a data science capstone focused on analyzing and predicting loan outcomes using the Lending Club dataset. The analysis is performed using Python and various data science libraries.

## Project Overview

The project analyzes Lending Club loan data to build a predictive model that can help identify loan default risks. It includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Model Development and Evaluation
